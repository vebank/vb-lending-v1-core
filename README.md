# VeBank Lending Protocol v1

This repository contains the smart contracts source code and markets configuration for VeBank Protocol V1.

## What is VeBank Lending?

VeBank is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity markets protocol where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers. Suppliers provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.
